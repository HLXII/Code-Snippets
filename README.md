# Code-Snippets

Repository for a bunch of random code snippets that I wrote. None of them particularly useful.

## GridMovement

Assume you are on an infinite grid of squares. Given a set number of random moves (either up, down, left, or right), what is the probability of landing on any square?

Given an even number of moves, any square with an odd coordinate sum will be impossible to land on, which leads to a checker pattern of squares.

The outcome (found through brute force) seems to be dependent on factorials and combinations, however I was too lazy to come up with the formula.

## Forest

A little journal of me trying to figure out how to generate all possible forests given a number of vertices in a graph.
